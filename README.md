> *This was our biggest project yet, but we’ve covered a huge amount of ground: adding `Comparable` to custom types, finding the documents directory, integrating `MapKit`, using biometric authentication, secure Data writing, and much more. And of course you have another real app, and hopefully you’re able to complete the challenges below to take it further.*

## &nbsp; 🎖 Challenge
* [x] Our + button is rather hard to tap. Try moving all its modifiers to the image inside the button – what difference does it make, and can you think why?

* [x] Our app silently fails when errors occur during biometric authentication, so add code to show those errors in an alert.

* [x] Create another view model, this time for `EditView`. What you put in the view model is down to you, but I would recommend leaving `dismiss` and `onSave` in the view itself – the former uses the environment, which can only be read by the view, and the latter doesn’t really add anything when moved into the model.
